# configure-azure-appservice-private-npm-feed

This is an opinionated deployment script as an npm package designed to configure Azure 
App Service web sites and Node.js apps that need to be augmented with a private NPM feed.

## How it works

### Unofficial but useful

This component was developed by the Open Source Programs Office at Microsoft. The OSPO team 
uses Node.js for some of its applications and has found this component to be useful. We are 
sharing this in the hope that others may find it useful.

It's important to understand that this library was developed for use by a team at Microsoft, but 
that this is not an official library or module built by the KeyVault or Azure App Service teams.
